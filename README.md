##  Hyporheic Zone Respiration is Constrained by Organic Matter Molecular Richness at the Continental Scale

This GitHub repository is associated with the publication "Hyporheic Zone Respiration is Constrained by Organic Matter Molecular Richness at the Continental Scale‚Äù.

The study aims to test the hypothesis that organic matter (OM) can be protected from degradation (in part) by high levels of molecular diversity, using publicly available data from the Worldwide Hydrobiogeochemical Observation Network for Dynamic River Systems (WHONDRS. 

Incubation and Field Sediment extracts were analyzed using ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). Respiration rates were measured using Incubation sediments following methods described by Garayburu-Caruso et., 2020. This repository contains the R scripts used to generate the figured in the manuscript. 

The data from the 97 global river corridors used in this manuscript were part of a WHONDRS (https://whondrs.pnnl.gov) study. The raw, unprocessed FTICR-MS data and respiration data can be found with additional data at doi:10.15485/1729719. Processed FTICR-MS data used in this manuscript was processes following instructions provided in the WHONDRS data package.
