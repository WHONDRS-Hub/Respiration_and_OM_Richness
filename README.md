#  Hyporheic Zone Respiration is Jointly Constrained by Organic Carbon Concentration and Molecular Richness

This GitHub repository is associated with the publication "Hyporheic Zone Respiration is Jointly Constrained by Organic Carbon Concentration and Molecular Richness” by Stegen et al., (202X).

The study aims to test the hypothesis that organic matter (OM) can be protected from degradation (in part) by high levels of molecular diversity, using publicly available data from the Worldwide Hydrobiogeochemical Observation Network for Dynamic River Systems (WHONDRS). 

Field Sediment extracts were analyzed using ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) as part of the WHONDRS S19S Campaign. Respiration rates were measured following methods described by Garayburu-Caruso et., 2020. This repository contains the R scripts used to generate the figured in the manuscript. 

The data from the 97 global river corridors used in this manuscript were part of a WHONDRS (https://whondrs.pnnl.gov) study. The raw, unprocessed FTICR-MS data and respiration data can be found with additional data at doi:10.15485/1729719. Processed FTICR-MS data used in this manuscript was processed following instructions provided in the WHONDRS data package and available in this GitHub repository.
