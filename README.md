# Trait-Based_Chemogeography_of_Organic_Matter_Thermodynamics

This GitHub repository is associated with the publication "Trait-Based Chemogeography of Organic Matter Thermodynamics‚Äù.

The study aims to understand large-scale spatial structure of the OM thermodynamic traits and global inter-trait relationships by investigating: (1) inland surface water and sediments collected along 97 global river corridors; and (2) coastal sediment collected from fresh and saline locations in Pacific and Gulf/Atlantic river corridors. 

Sediment extracts and water samples were analyzed using ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). This repository is comprised of two folders (1) Coastal, and (2) WHONDR_S19S and is associated with the ESS-DIVE data packagae. 

Coastal contains (1) a subfolder with processed FTICR data as csv files and sample collection metadata, (2) a subfolder with R scripts used to process the data, and create associated figures, (3) a subfolder with the raw, unprocessed FTICR-MS data as .xml files and (4) a readme file with more information about the dataset and instructions for using Formularity (https://omics.pnl.gov/software/formularity). 

WHONDRS_S19S contains (1) a csv file with processed FTICR data, (2) a csv with sample collection metadata, (3) a subfolder with R scripts used to process the data and create associated figures, and (4) a readme file with more information regarding WHONDRS raw FTICR data and processing scripts. 

The 97 global river corridors were part of a WHONDRS (https://whondrs.pnnl.gov) study. The raw, unprocessed FTICR-MS data can be found with additional data at doi:10.15485/1729719, for sediments and doi:10.15485/1603775, for water. This data package contains the processed data used in the associated manuscript. The coastal data has not been previously published, and this data package contains both the raw and processed data.
